<p> I am 25 years old and live in the small city of Macedonia on the outskirts of Cleveland.  I have one brother, named Justin, who is a couple years younger than me, as well as a dog named Mickey and a turtle named Fuji, named after my favorite Habachi Japanese Steak House.  I enjoy pretty much any activities outside including fishing, hiking, and golfing.  In my free time I also enjoy to go to the gym to work out. When Ohio weather is changing and I'm forced to stay indoors I like to play xbox and watch netflix. Watching sports has become my favorite past time, my favorite football teams include, the Cleveland Browns and Denver Broncos. When I'm not watching football, I watch the Cleveland Indians as well as the Cavaliers. I just recently became involved with programing, I was eager to learn more about it after learning some basics on Code Acadamy. </p>
